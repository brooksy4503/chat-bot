# Cyberpunk Theme Heading Readability Fix

## Problem

The headings in markdown content (`h1` through `h6`) were not readable when using the cyberpunk theme. The issue was that the cyberpunk theme had dark, low-contrast backgrounds, but the heading text color was not properly configured for this dark theme. The existing heading styles only included variants for standard light theme (`text-zinc-900`) and dark theme (`dark:text-zinc-100`), but lacked specific styling for the cyberpunk theme.

## Investigation

Upon examining the code, several issues were found:

1. In `components/markdown.tsx`, heading components only included standard and dark theme color classes:
   ```tsx
   <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100">
   ```

2. While the cyberpunk theme was defined in `app/globals.css`, the heading text colors were not properly overridden for the theme.

3. In the browser, the rendered heading elements were using dark colors against the dark cyberpunk background, causing poor readability.

## Solution

The fix involved a two-part approach:

### 1. Update Component Classes in `markdown.tsx`

Added the cyberpunk variant class to all heading components (`h1` through `h6`):

```tsx
<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1 text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100 black:text-zinc-100 cyberpunk:text-zinc-100">
```

This ensures that when the cyberpunk theme is active, the text color has a fallback to a light color, improving contrast.

### 2. Add Theme-Specific CSS in `globals.css`

Created specific styling rules for cyberpunk theme headings in `app/globals.css`:

```css
/* Cyberpunk heading styles - each heading directly targeted */
.cyberpunk h1 {
  /* Even brighter Cyan for maximum contrast */
  color: oklch(0.98 0.20 180) !important;
  /* Bolder font for better visibility */
  font-weight: 700 !important;
}

/* Similar rules for h2-h6 */
```

Key improvements:
- Used a bright cyan color (`oklch(0.98 0.20 180)`) for maximum contrast against the dark cyberpunk background
- Added `!important` to ensure the styles override any other conflicting styles
- Used individual selectors for each heading element for maximum specificity
- Applied bold font weight (`700`) to enhance visibility

## Results

After implementing these changes, the headings in the cyberpunk theme are now clearly visible with high contrast, making the content readable while maintaining the cyberpunk aesthetic.

## Lessons Learned

1. When implementing themes, ensure all text elements have appropriate contrast settings for each theme variant.
2. CSS specificity matters - individual selectors with `!important` may be necessary when dealing with complex theme interactions.
3. When troubleshooting, examine the actual rendered HTML elements in the browser to see which CSS classes and properties are being applied.
